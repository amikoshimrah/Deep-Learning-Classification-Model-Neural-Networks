# Deep-Learning-Classification-Model-Neural-Networks
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **deep learning workflow** for classification tasks using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
It covers data preprocessing, building and training neural networks, evaluating accuracy and loss, and visualizing performance.  
The project show how the baseline model and optimized model works on Insurance data.
